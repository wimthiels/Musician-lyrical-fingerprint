python and R workflow

PYTHON : get the data
1) start from a file with all the songlyrics of the billboardcharts over the years, and
   use this to determine the most common words each artist uses (only the most common engish words
   are considered (check nounlist)
2) clean up the data
3) enrich the data with artistinfo by webscraping the Allmusic.com site

R : analyse the data
